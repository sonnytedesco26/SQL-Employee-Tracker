## Description

For this project, the goal was to create an application to view/interact with a content management system. The database in use (employeesdb) has 3 tables (department, role, and employee), along with some dummy data to populate them.

## Required Packages

MySQL2
Inquirer
ConsoleTable

## Installation

After cloning the repository, the user must run the schema.sql file (SQLStuff/schema.sql). If dummy data present in the tables are desired, then run seeds.sql afterwards.

To view the mysql database, run 'mysql -u root -p' from the terminal in the root directory of the project.

## Use

To run the app, run 'npm start' from the root directory of the project. From there, the user will be asked what they want to do from the main menu (View department/role/employee,add department/role/employee, and update employee role).
